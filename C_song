It all started with constant and variable,
still I'm lagging behind to print ASCII table.
First place was to get to Hello World,
Now it seems more comedic than kumar and harold.
'if' was stiff , 'else' tried to put us down,
and there came the loop , round and round.
First algorithm was to make the tea,
Next we got-"ward you must get 'let us c'".
"don't forget to put .c as extension"
we passed the arguments ,started calling function.
DBC sir said "ya'll can have my trust",
but go now and declare this array first.
easy wad string, pointers are real thing,
python gotta serve, C gotta be King.
